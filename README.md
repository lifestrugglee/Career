### Better way to get correlation - 2020/11/30
To easily having a vision of correlation results, I built this webpage by using Python as a backend. 

Instead of continuing editing on the excel files after the value updated, I created the python code to automatically read the files and generated the results with HTML, CSS, JQuery, Javascript, and Bootstrap.

#### Details
Python Package: glob, numpy

JQuery: 3.5.1

Bootstrap: 3.4.1
